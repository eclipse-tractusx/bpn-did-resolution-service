# Introduction

In a Tractus-X dataspace participants use Business Partner Numbers (BPNs) as stable identifiers for any data exchange.
However, the identity protocol uses Decentralized Identifiers (DIDs) as identifiers.

The BPN-DID-Resolution-Service is a core component of the Tractus-X landscape, which binds BPNs to DIDs and provides a
lookup API for participants.

Its [directory API](./4_runtime.md) must be accessible to every participant in the dataspace.
